The following is a property reference for the Object.\n\n### methods\n\nType: `Array`  \nDefault: `[ 'GET', 'HEAD' ]`\n\nThis property allows a user to pass the list of HTTP request methods accepted by the middleware\\*\\*.\n\n### headers\n\nType: `Object`  \nDefault: `undefined`\n\nThis property allows a user to pass custom HTTP headers on each request.\neg. `{ \"X-Custom-Header\": \"yes\" }`\n\n### index\n\nType: `Boolean|String`  \nDefault: `index.html`\n\nIf `false` (but not `undefined`), the server will not respond to requests to the root URL.\n\n### mimeTypes\n\nType: `Object`  \nDefault: `undefined`\n\nThis property allows a user to register custom mime types or extension mappings.\neg. `mimeTypes: { phtml: 'text/html' }`.\n\nPlease see the documentation for [`mime-types`](https://github.com/jshttp/mime-types) for more information.\n\n### publicPath\n\nType: `String`\nDefault: `output.publicPath` (from a configuration)\n\nThe public path that the middleware is bound to.\n\n_Best Practice: use the same `publicPath` defined in your webpack config. For more information about `publicPath`, please see [the webpack documentation](https://webpack.js.org/guides/public-path)._\n\n### stats\n\nType: `Boolean|String|Object`\nDefault: `stats` (from a configuration)\n\nStats options object or preset name.\n\n### serverSideRender\n\nType: `Boolean`  \nDefault: `undefined`\n\nInstructs the module to enable or disable the server-side rendering mode.\nPlease see [Server-Side Rendering](#server-side-rendering) for more information.\n\n### writeToDisk\n\nType: `Boolean|Function`  \nDefault: `false`\n\nIf `true`, the option will instruct the module to write files to the configured location on disk as specified in your `webpack` config file.\n_Setting `writeToDisk: true` won't change the behavior of the `webpack-dev-middleware`, and bundle files accessed through the browser will still be served from memory._\nThis option provides the same capabilities as the [`WriteFilePlugin`](https://github.com/gajus/write-file-webpack-plugin/pulls).\n\nThis option also accepts a `Function` value, which can be used to filter which files are written to disk.\nThe function follows the same premise as [`Array#filter`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter) in which a return value of `false` _will not_ write the file, and a return value of `true` _will_ write the file to disk. eg.\n\n```js\nconst webpack = require('webpack');\nconst configuration = {\n  /* Webpack configuration */\n};\nconst compiler = webpack(configuration);\n\nmiddleware(compiler, {\n  writeToDisk: (filePath) => {\n    return /superman\\.css$/.test(filePath);\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### outputFileSystem\n\nType: `Object`  \nDefault: [memfs](https://github.com/streamich/memfs)\n\nSet the default file system which will be used by webpack as primary destination of generated files.\nThis option isn't affected by the [writeToDisk](#writeToDisk) option.\n\nYou have to provide `.join()` and `mkdirp` method to the `outputFileSystem` instance manually for compatibility with `webpack@4`.\n\nThis can be done simply by using `path.join`:\n\n```js\nconst webpack = require('webpack');\nconst path = require('path');\nconst myOutputFileSystem = require('my-fs');\nconst mkdirp = require('mkdirp');\n\nmyOutputFileSystem.join = path.join.bind(path); // no need to bind\nmyOutputFileSystem.mkdirp = mkdirp.bind(mkdirp); // no need to bind\n\nconst compiler = webpack({\n  /* Webpack configuration */\n});\n\nmiddleware(compiler, { outputFileSystem: myOutputFileSystem });\n```\n\n## API\n\n`webpack-dev-middleware` also provides convenience methods that can be use to\ninteract with the middleware at runtime:\n\n### `close(callback)`\n\nInstructs a webpack-dev-middleware instance to stop watching for file changes.\n\n### Parameters\n\n#### callback\n\nType: `Function`\n\nA function executed once the middleware has stopped watching.\n\n### `invalidate()`\n\nInstructs a webpack-dev-middleware instance to recompile the bundle.\ne.g. after a change to the configuration.\n\n```js\nconst webpack = require('webpack');\nconst compiler = webpack({ ... });\nconst middleware = require('webpack-dev-middleware');\nconst instance = middleware(compiler);\n\napp.use(instance);\n\nsetTimeout(() => {\n  // After a short delay the configuration is changed and a banner plugin is added\n  // to the config\n  new webpack.BannerPlugin('A new banner').apply(compiler);\n\n  // Recompile the bundle with the banner plugin:\n  instance.invalidate();\n}, 1000);\n```\n\n### `waitUntilValid(callback)`\n\nExecutes a callback function when the compiler bundle is valid, typically after\ncompilation.\n\n### Parameters\n\n#### callback\n\nType: `Function`\n\nA function executed when the bundle becomes valid. If the bundle is\nvalid at the time of calling, the callback is executed immediately.\n\n```js\nconst webpack = require('webpack');\nconst compiler = webpack({ ... });\nconst middleware = require('webpack-dev-middleware');\nconst instance = middleware(compiler);\n\napp.use(instance);\n\ninstance.waitUntilValid(() => {\n  console.log('Package is in a valid state');\n});\n```\n\n## Known Issues\n\n### Multiple Successive Builds\n\nWatching will frequently cause multiple compilations\nas the bundle changes during compilation. This is due in part to cross-platform\ndifferences in file watchers, so that webpack doesn't loose file changes when\nwatched files change rapidly. If you run into this situation, please make use of\nthe [`TimeFixPlugin`](https://github.com/egoist/time-fix-plugin).\n\n## Server-Side Rendering\n\n_Note: this feature is experimental and may be removed or changed completely in the future._\n\nIn order to develop an app using server-side rendering, we need access to the\n[`stats`](https://github.com/webpack/docs/wiki/node.js-api#stats), which is\ngenerated with each build.\n\nWith server-side rendering enabled, `webpack-dev-middleware` sets the `stats` to `res.locals.webpack.devMiddleware.stats`\nand the filesystem to `res.locals.webpack.devMiddleware.outputFileSystem` before invoking the next middleware,\nallowing a developer to render the page body and manage the response to clients.\n\n_Note: Requests for bundle files will still be handled by\n`webpack-dev-middleware` and all requests will be pending until the build\nprocess is finished with server-side rendering enabled._\n\nExample Implementation:\n\n```js\nconst webpack = require('webpack');\nconst compiler = webpack({\n  // webpack options\n});\nconst isObject = require('is-object');\nconst middleware = require('webpack-dev-middleware');\n\n// This function makes server rendering of asset references consistent with different webpack chunk/entry configurations\nfunction normalizeAssets(assets) {\n  if (isObject(assets)) {\n    return Object.values(assets);\n  }\n\n  return Array.isArray(assets) ? assets : [assets];\n}\n\napp.use(middleware(compiler, { serverSideRender: true }));\n\n// The following middleware would not be invoked until the latest build is finished.\napp.use((req, res) => {\n  const { devMiddleware } = res.locals.webpack;\n  const outputFileSystem = devMiddleware.outputFileSystem;\n  const jsonWebpackStats = devMiddleware.stats.toJson();\n  const { assetsByChunkName, outputPath } = jsonWebpackStats;\n\n  // Then use `assetsByChunkName` for server-side rendering\n  // For example, if you have only one main chunk:\n  res.send(`\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>My App</title>\n    <style>\n    ${normalizeAssets(assetsByChunkName.main)\n      .filter((path) => path.endsWith('.css'))\n      .map((path) => outputFileSystem.readFileSync(path.join(outputPath, path)))\n      .join('\\n')}\n    </style>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"root\"></div>\n    ${normalizeAssets(assetsByChunkName.main)\n      .filter((path) => path.endsWith('.js'))\n      .map((path) => `<script src=\"${path}\"></script>`)\n      .join('\\n')}\n  </body>\n</html>\n  `);\n});\n```\n\n## Support\n\nWe do our best to keep Issues in the repository focused on bugs, features, and\nneeded modifications to the code for the module. Because of that, we ask users\nwith general support, \"how-to\", or \"why isn't this working\" questions to try one\nof the other support channels that are available.\n\nYour first-stop-shop for support for webpack-dev-server should by the excellent\n[documentation][docs-url] for the module. If you see an opportunity for improvement\nof those docs, please head over to the [webpack.js.org repo][wjo-url] and open a\npull request.\n\nFrom there, we encourage users to visit the [webpack Gitter chat][chat-url] and\ntalk to the fine folks there. If your quest for answers comes up dry in chat,\nhead over to [StackOverflow][stack-url] and do a quick search or open a new\nquestion. Remember; It's always much easier to answer questions that include your\n`webpack.config.js` and relevant files!\n\nIf you're twitter-savvy you can tweet [#webpack][hash-url] with your question\nand someone should be able to reach out and lend a hand.\n\nIf you have discovered a :bug:, have a feature suggestion, or would like to see\na modification, please feel free to create an issue on Github. _Note: The issue\ntemplate isn't optional, so please be sure not to remove it, and please fill it\nout completely._\n\n## Other servers\n\nExamples of use with other servers will follow here.\n\n### Fastify\n\nFastify interop will require the use of `fastify-express` instead of `middie` for providing middleware support. As the authors of `fastify-express` recommend, this should only be used as a stopgap while full Fastify support is worked on.\n\n```js\nconst fastify = require('fastify')();\nconst webpack = require('webpack');\nconst webpackConfig = require('./webpack.config.js');\nconst devMiddleware = require('webpack-dev-middleware');\n\nconst compiler = webpack(webpackConfig);\nconst { publicPath } = webpackConfig.output;\n\n(async () => {\n  await fastify.register(require('fastify-express'));\n  await fastify.use(devMiddleware(compiler, { publicPath }));\n  await fastify.listen(3000);\n})();\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease take a moment to read our contributing guidelines if you haven't yet done so.\n\n[CONTRIBUTING](./CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](./LICENSE)\n\n[npm]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/webpack-dev-middleware.svg\n[npm-url]: https://npmjs.com/package/webpack-dev-middleware\n[node]: https://img.shields.io/node/v/webpack-dev-middleware.svg\n[node-url]: https://nodejs.org\n[deps]: https://david-dm.org/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware.svg\n[deps-url]: https://david-dm.org/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware\n[tests]: https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/workflows/webpack-dev-middleware/badge.svg\n[tests-url]: https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/actions\n[cover]: https://codecov.io/gh/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/branch/master/graph/badge.svg\n[cover-url]: https://codecov.io/gh/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware\n[chat]: https://badges.gitter.im/webpack/webpack.svg\n[chat-url]: https://gitter.im/webpack/webpack\n[size]: https://packagephobia.com/badge?p=webpack-dev-middleware\n[size-url]: https://packagephobia.com/result?p=webpack-dev-middleware\n[docs-url]: https://webpack.js.org/guides/development/#using-webpack-dev-middleware\n[hash-url]: https://twitter.com/search?q=webpack\n[middleware-url]: https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware\n[stack-url]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/webpack-dev-middleware\n[wjo-url]: https://github.com/webpack/webpack.js.org\n",
